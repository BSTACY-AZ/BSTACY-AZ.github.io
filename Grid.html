                I'm Brandon and I am an aspiring web developer from Scottsdale, Arizona. 
                I have dabbled over the years in VB.NET, C#.NET, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Apex and finally
                decided to take a professionally guided course relating to full stack MERN
                development. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm looking forward to linking all of my past and future work here on this 
                site as I progress and am very excited to watch this site evolve along with my skill set. 
                In my free time I enjoy spending time with my wife, son, and three dogs as 
                well as golf, travel, and playing guitar.
