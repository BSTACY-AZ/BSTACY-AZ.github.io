                        <p class="text-start">
                        Believe it or not, I started my professional career in the hotel business. In fact, I was working as an Assistant General Manager for Hilton Hotels in 1997 when I first got wind that a software company in Phoenix, Arizona was hiring Technical Support Representatives. This was right during the "Dot-com" boom of the late 1990's and amazingly, I had only just begun to access the internet as an end user and knew nothing whatsoever about computers or IT. </p>
                        
                        <p>In order to be considered for the position a candidate needed to have either a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science which I did not have, or the candidate needed to have extensive experience within the hotel industry. You see, the software that this company made, was Property Management System software or the software that a front desk agent would use to for example check guests in and out of their hotel. At risk of sounding incredibly cliche, it seemed liked destiny to me at the time.</p>
                        
                        <p>Unfortunately, I was passed up for the open position. On top of that the company instituted an indefinite hiring freeze once that position was filled. I was told that there was no way of knowing just when they might look to hire again. I simply took note of the hiring managers contact information and promised to keep in touch. </p>

                        <p>Over the next four months I called the hiring manager every two weeks to follow up and to remind him that I was still very much interested if and when the hiring freeze was ever lifted. It was eventually lifted and I did eventually get the job although it very well could have been in order to keep me from harassing the hiring manager.</p>

                        <p>In the 24 years since I've worked as an IT Consultant, Technical Account Representitive, Mortgage Broker, Chief Technology Officer and Chief Operations Officer among many others. Throughout all of my various roles I have always maintained at my core a love for software development. Having dabbled over the years in VB.NET, C#.NET, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Apex I am finally working toward an official career in that space and have decided to take a professionally guided course relating to full stack MERN development. While earlier in my career I was focused on all of the standard things that young professionals care about, my mindset today simply comes down to two things. I want to be useful, and I want to help build things. </p>
                        
                        <p>So ends my five paragraph synopsis of the last 25 years of my professional life. When I'm not studying or trying to find problems to solve I enjoy spending time with my wife, son, and three dogs as well as golfing, traveling, playing video games, woodworking, and playing guitar. Thanks for taking the time to learn a little bit more about me. I hope we have the opportunity to connect soon!
